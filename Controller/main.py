#TO DO:
#
# (COMPLETE) COMMENT OUT START BUTTON FROM VIEW CLASS (USER INTERFACE)
#	-> Functionality already gotten rid of
#
# IMPLEMENT DISOLVING OF FULL ROWS
#	-> Was able to implement detection of full rows but have issues when attempting to disolve those rows
#		-> Above pieces seem to respond to a row being disolved (will fall to bottom of board after that row 
#			has been disolved) but the color` of the cells that was disolved, do not change. 
#	-> POSSIBLE REASON: after each game loop, there is a function that iterates over every piece on board
#		and calls the 'set_board_values' method for that piece
#			-> Need to figure out how to 'delete' a cell from a instance of a piece	
#
#
# IMPLEMENT GAME ENDING WHEN BLOCKS REACH TOP OF BOARD
#
# IMPLEMENT POINTS SYSTEM
#	-> (COMPLETE) Give model class a point attribute and add to it as rows are dissolved
#	-> (COMPLETE) 10 points per row dissolved
#		-> Bonus points for 5 consecutive rows being dissolved   
#
# IMPLEMENT POINTS INTERFACE
#	-> Add small box in which current point value (retrieve from model's point attribute) will be displayed
#
# FIX BUGS
#
#KNOWN BUGS:
#
# ROTATION ISSUE ON LEFT WALL 
# 	-> When rotating pieces while up against left wall, cells of shape will 
# 	appear all the way on the right side
#
# ROTATION ISSUE ON RIGHT WALL
#	-> When rotating pieces while up against the right wall, cell coords are being transformed
#   to out of range coords
#
#		POSSIBLE FIX: 
#			-> check new coords after transformation to see if they fall
#			within range of board coords. If they do not, cancel the rotation
#
